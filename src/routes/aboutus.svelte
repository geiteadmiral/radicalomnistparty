<h2>About Us</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>We are a political party created in 2003 after we saw a platypus swimming around the trash we dumped in the ocean. The different features of the platypus gave us the revelation that more is better. The platypus had everything, and it was beautiful. We decided to utilize the confines of my pantaloons to carry the animal home. Sandra told me to stop using “we” because she had absolutely nothing to do with any of this, but she is just in denial. </p>
<p>I quit my job in 2009 to focus solely on our political passion. Sandra even got a second job to fund it. “I need to feed our family”, she said. “What family?” I asked, before she revealed she was pregnant. Suddenly, our triplets were born, further radicalizing the both of us. “We can’t keep going like this…” she said, and she was right. We cannot let our children grow up in the current world. We need to make the world more radical. More radical omnist. </p>
<p>We went on to have two more sets of twins, one in 2011 and one in 2015. All to motivate us to make our political dream come true. Sandra said that her intention was to babytrap me and force me to get a hold of myself. However, the voices told be the truth of her intentions, so I know Sandra is fully with me here. </p>
<p>Since then, we have recruited several members to the party. Such as the homeless meth addict I let sleep in my garage, or all the kids from the preschool down the street. We are all working together to give you the radical omnist future you deserve.    </p>
